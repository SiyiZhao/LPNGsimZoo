# Generate ICs with FastPM 

Here we show an example (the scripts we used), replace the settings and input files with your own.

- Refer the `.qsub` and/or `.slurm` files for the submission script.
- The configuration file is `ic-settings.lua`.
- Should input linear matter power spectrum calculated by `CAMB`, an example is `Planck2015Table4LastColumn_matterpower.dat`.
