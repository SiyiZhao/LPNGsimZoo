# Nbody codes 

We test several Nbody codes. 
These works are done on a remote computer, so pay attention to the paths.

Read the details in [Cheng's notes](./nbody-code.md).

## PKDgrav3

We test the [PKDgrav3 code](https://pkdgrav3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on a computer with GPU, named 'r88'. 
We show the scripts and configuration files, but there are 2 'lib' codes keeped on `r88` but not this repo: 1. the PKDgrav3 code, 2. the 2LPT code used is the version same as Quijote's.

The test is with the following settings:
- L=1Gpc/h, N=512^3,
- z_i=127, z_f=0, Nstep=100, 
- the IC is generated by 2LPT code, the origin format is gadget, and then convert to hdf5 as PKDgrav3 code need.
- gpu: 3090/H200; cpu: 32 cores, 128 threads.
It takes ~2 hours on 3090, or ~1 hour on H200.

We also test the code without GPU acceleration on H200, it takes half an hour more.

### FoF Halos

The inputs at this step are: `<linking length> [minimum particle number]`, refer to [Quijote paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05273), the linking length is 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation, and the minimum particle number is 20.

We first try to find FoF halos with the PKDgrav3 code. Refer the [docs](https://pkdgrav3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html#PKDGRAV.fof), and see also the [issue](https://bitbucket.org/dpotter/pkdgrav3/issues/39/an-error-in-postprocessing-fof-halo-finder). But it seems there are still some bugs in the code, it takes a long time to run without useful output.

Then we choose [nbodykit.algorithms.fof.FOF](https://nbodykit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/nbodykit.algorithms.fof.html#nbodykit.algorithms.fof.FOF) to find the FoF halos. See `pkd_nbfof.py`, where we first read Tipsy snapshots to get particles positions and velocities, and then run the FoF algorithm. Finally, the output is saved in bigfile format.

#### HMF 

We compare the HMF with Quijote, as [Quijote doc/Reading FoF](https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples/Reading_FoF.html) suggested. See `plot/HMF.py` for the details.


## MP-Gadget

We test the [MP-Gadget code](https://github.com/MP-Gadget/MP-Gadget) with the same configurations as Quijote.

- The input IC and output snapshot of MP-Gadget is in bigfile format.
