# Compare the ICs Generated 

## PNG-2LPTic and FastPM-DESI

The Headers are same with each other. 

We once directly compare the output Positions, they are not the same. The possible reason is that 1. random generator is different, 2. FastPM is able to suppress the cosmic variance while 2LPTic is not.

Then the comparison should be done with the statistics, say, power spectrum and bispectrum.
