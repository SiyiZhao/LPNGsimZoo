# LPNG Simulations Zoo

For non-linear modeling of Cosmic Large Scale Stuctures (CLaSS, LSS) with Local-type Primordial non-Gaussianity (LPNG), we need sets of simulations with LPNG.

## Simulation Sets

We have following sets:
1. Nbody simulations in 1Gpc/h with several $f_{\rm NL}$ values for model calibrate and emulator. 

Refer a summary of other LPNG simulation sets in [TBD].

## Tests of Codes 

### Initial Condition

- 2LPT-PNGnonlocal
- MonofonIC 
- FastPM-DESI

### Nbody

We test 4 Nbody codes:
- Gadget4
- CUBE
- MP-Gadget
- PKDgrav3

See the details in the [Nbodycode.md](notes/Nbodycode.md) file.
